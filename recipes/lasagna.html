    <h2>Turkey Riggies - Forget About It</h2>

    <p>If you like chicken riggies, I think you're going to love turkey riggies, especially if you're trying to
        disappear
        the last of the Thanksgiving leftovers. We cover this every year, but after a day of leftovers, and another day
        of
        sandwiches, we're usually in the mood for something a different, and this really fits the bill.</p>

    <p>In case you're not familiar with "riggies," it's a Central New York specialty featuring rigatoni pasta tossed
        with
        chicken and peppers in a spicy tomato sauce. It's flavorful, comforting, regional Italian-American food at it's
        finest, and while not usually baked, this works very nicely presented as a crusty, cheesy casserole.</p>

    <p>Besides the obvious advantages, this delicious leftover turkey delivery system should erase any and all memories
        of
        what may have been a dry, unremarkable bird. Hey, it happens to the best of us. But, simply mix that less than
        amazing meat into the rest of these ingredients, and all will be forgotten. By the way, this works even if your
        turkey was amazingly tender, and juicy. Either way, I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
